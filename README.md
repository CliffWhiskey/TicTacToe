# TicTacToe
MIT MERN Class Exercise TicTacToe


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- [ ] Feature 1 -Timer for the game would encompass time component, storage of time each player took to select a box, passing to parent element from child element the time taken. then storage of accumulated time for each player for each instance of the game.
    - [ ] The future revision to include accumulated time by each player over multiple games until exit from overall game 
- [ ] Feature 2 The  current  iteration of the game does recognize a tie or that the game is over. Would need to add to state the recognition of a tied and a recognition of the max number of clicks (or changes of player). The code would need to add elements to monitor the instance that one play has won.
